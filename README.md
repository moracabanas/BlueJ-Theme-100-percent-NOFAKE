Easy to install - Forget annoying white background forever
=================

As you know, BlueJ theme is $%#&! so I made my own one.

Reporting bugs
--------------

There is no bugs on my code. 
But, the process is destructive so be careful and do your /lib folder backups. 


Installation instructions
-------



* Simply clone or drop the /lib folder and overwrite it into your BlueJ root folder. It should be:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\BlueJ`

But it depends on the SO you use.
